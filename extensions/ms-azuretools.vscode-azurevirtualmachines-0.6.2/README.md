3. Type a name for your VM.  Alphanumeric characters are all valid.
4. Type a passphrase or leave it empty for no passphrase.
    >For security reasons, it's _highly_ recommended that you use a passphrase for your SSH key.  It is what will be used to connect to your VM via SSH.

The VM will be **Standard D2s V3** (2 CPU Cores & 8 GB of ram) with the image **Ubuntu 18.04-LTS**. An SSH key will be created and your SSH Config file (`~/.ssh/config`) will be updated so you can immediately connect via SSH (`$ ssh vm-name`) or using the [Remote-SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) extension.


### Add SSH key to existing Virtual Machine

If you have an existing VM that you would like to add your own SSH key too, you can do that by right-clicking the VM tree item, clicking **Add SSH Key...**, and selecting an existing SSH key. You can generate an SSH key using [SSH Keygen](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/keygen#creating-an-ssh-key-pair-for-user-authentication) if you don't have any keys on your system.

Your SSH Config (`~/.ssh/config`) file will be updated so you can connect via SSH using `$ ssh vm-name`.

> NOTE: This command is only available for Linux virtual machines.
